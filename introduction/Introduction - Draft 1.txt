1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background of the System
The car rental industry has undergone a massive shift from traditional physical
storefronts to digital platforms. In the past, customers had to visit a rental office,
manually fill out paperwork, and rely on the staff's verbal confirmation of car
availability. This process was often slow, prone to human error, and limited by
business operating hours.
The Online Car Rental System is a web-based solution designed to modernize this
process. It acts as a centralized platform where vehicle data, customer information,
and booking schedules are integrated into a single database. This allows for real-time
synchronization, ensuring that once a car is booked, it is immediately removed from
the available list, preventing double-bookings.

1.2 Purpose of the System
The primary purpose of this system is to simplify the rental experience for both the
service provider and the customer. Specifically, it aims to:
● Enhance Accessibility: Allow customers to browse and book vehicles 24/7
from any location via the internet.
● Improve Efficiency: Automate the booking and payment process, reducing the
need for manual data entry and administrative overhead.
● Data Accuracy: Maintain a real-time record of vehicle availability,
maintenance status, and financial transactions.
● Customer Trust: Provide a transparent platform where users can see clear
pricing, car specifications, and manage their own booking history.

1.3 Overall Idea and Context
The main idea of the system is to build a self-service environment where customers
actively manage their own rental process. Rather than simply receiving information,
users take control by registering their own accounts, searching for cars that match
their preferences such as budget, brand, or vehicle size and completing payments
securely on their own.
In a wider perspective, this system aligns with the demands of the modern digital
economy. It enables a car rental business to grow efficiently by replacing traditional,
paper-based operations with a centralized, cloud-based platform. Beyond just renting
vehicles, the system supports the entire rental lifecycle, from user registration, car
selection and payment, to reservation management and status tracking.
