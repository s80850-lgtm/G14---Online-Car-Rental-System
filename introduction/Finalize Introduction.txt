1.0 Introduction
	1.1 Background of the System
The car rental industry has experienced a significant transformation as traditional, manual rental processes are gradually replaced by digital platforms. In the past, customers were required to visit physical rental offices, manually complete paperwork, and depend on staff to confirm vehicle availability. This approach was often time-consuming, prone to human error, and restricted by business operating hours (TechBullion, 2023).
To address these limitations, online car rental systems have been introduced to provide a more efficient and user-friendly solution. The Online Car Rental System is a web-based platform that centralizes vehicle information, customer data, and booking schedules into a single database. Through real-time synchronization, the system ensures that once a vehicle is booked, it is immediately removed from the available list, reducing the risk of double bookings and improving operational accuracy (TechBullion, 2023).

1.2 Purpose of the System
The primary purpose of the Online Car Rental System is to simplify and improve the rental experience for both customers and service providers. The system is designed to enhance accessibility by allowing users to browse and book vehicles at any time and from any location via the internet (TechBullion, 2023).
In addition, the system improves efficiency by automating key processes such as booking confirmation, availability checking, and payment processing, thereby reducing manual administrative work and operational delays (RentlySoft, 2022). The centralized database also ensures data accuracy by maintaining up-to-date records of vehicle availability, rental history, and financial transactions. By providing transparent pricing, vehicle details, and booking information, the system helps build customer trust and confidence in the rental service (RentlySoft, 2022).

1.3 Overall Idea and Context
The core idea of the Online Car Rental System is to establish a self-service environment where customers actively manage their rental activities. Users are able to register their own accounts, search for vehicles based on preferences such as budget, brand, or vehicle type, and complete secure payments without direct staff involvement (TechBullion, 2023). This approach empowers users and enhances convenience while reducing dependency on manual support.
In a broader context, the system aligns with the needs of the modern digital economy, where consumers expect fast, reliable, and online-based services. By adopting a centralized and cloud-based platform, car rental companies can expand their operations, improve service quality, and replace traditional paper-based workflows with automated and data-driven processes (RentlySoft, 2022).
